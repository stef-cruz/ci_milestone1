Call & Collect Service from Dublin City Library
======


Overview
------

The [Call & Collect](https://stefcruz.github.io/ci_milestone1/) is an existing service offered by the Dublin City Libraries in response to the pandemic when the libraries were closed. 

The main purpose of the website is to promote the service, explanining how library users can avail of this new initiative and which branches have taken part of the service. 

Library users can check if a particular book is available on the shelf in one of the 10 branches they want to collect from, and then contact the branch by phone or email or ask-a-librarian to hold the book for them. Library staff will then organise a date and time for the library user to go to their preferred library for collection.
